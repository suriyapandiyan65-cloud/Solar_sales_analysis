# Solar_sales_analysis
Analyzed solar sales data to identify revenue trends, customer segments, and growth opportunities using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Solar Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing solar product sales data to identify sales trends, regional performance, and revenue drivers. The analysis covers the complete data analytics lifecycle from data loading and cleaning to SQL-based analysis and interactive dashboard creation ending with business insights presented through a report and presentation.


## Dataset
- Contains historical solar sales data including:
  - Date and Year
  - Region
  - Product Category
  - Units Sold
  - Unit Price
  - Total Sales
- Dataset was loaded and processed using Python for analysis and SQL Server for querying.



## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas
- **SQL Server**: Data storage and SQL querying  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard and visualizations  
- **Gamma**: Presentation (PPT) creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis environment  


## Project Steps
1. Loaded the solar sales dataset into Python  
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends  
3. Cleaned data by handling missing values and correcting data types  
4. Imported cleaned data into SQL Server  
5. Wrote SQL queries to analyze sales, revenue, and regional performance  
6. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs and charts  
7. Created a detailed analytical report  
8. Prepared a business-focused presentation using Gamma  


## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard highlights:
- Total Sales and Revenue trends  
- Regional and product-wise performance  
- Year-over-year sales comparison  
- Key KPIs for business decision-making  


## Results & Insights
- Identified top-performing regions and product categories  
- Observed seasonal trends in solar product sales  
- Highlighted revenue growth opportunities in underperforming regions  
- Provided actionable insights to support sales and marketing strategies
